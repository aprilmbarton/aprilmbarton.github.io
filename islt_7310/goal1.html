<li class="hangingindent">The independent variable in an experiment is a condition that is manipulated or changed by a scientist. 
    There should only be one independent variable in an experiment. This makes sure only one thing is affecting the experiment. </li>
<li class="hangingindent">The dependent variable is observed and measured during an experiment. It responds to the independent variable.</li> 
<li class="hangingindent">The conditions that do not change during an experiment are known as constants.</li> 
<li class="hangingindent">An experimental group is the group that receives the change. </li>
<li class="hangingindent">The control group does not receive the change. A control group is used to compare the results of the experimental groups. </li>
<li class="hangingindent">The hypothesis is what you think will happen in the experiment. When writing a hypothesis, you use the following format:  
    If independent variable, then dependent variable. You explain what you are doing to the independent variable and tell what you think will happen to the dependent variable as a result of what you did to the independent variable. </li>
<li class="hangingindent">Multiple trials are used to increase the reliability of results.</li>
