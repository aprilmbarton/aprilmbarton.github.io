        <p>Welcome to April Barton’s Experimental Design Site. This site is designed as an educational site.
          The purpose of the site is to expose students to experimental design and help students learn 
          about the different parts of experimental design.</p>
            <p><h3>About the Site</h3></p>
            <p>As a science teacher, I know that experimental design is an important topic for students to master in high school 
                science classes.  The goal this site is to help students master the topic of experimental design.  
                 The site’s objective is to help students understand how to correctly use experimental design.  
                 Students will be exposed to definitions of each part of experimental design, such as independent, 
                 dependent variables, constants, control group, and experimental group.  Students will be given 
                 an example experiment and each part of the experimental design with be explained using 
                 that example.  Students will also be taught how to graph using the information in experimental
                  design. </p>
