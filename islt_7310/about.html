              <h3>About Me</h3>
              <p>Hi everyone, I am <em>April Barton</em>. I teach biology and anatomy. 
                          I live in <em>Kansas City, Missouri</em>. I am married with two daughters.  
                          I earned my bachelor’s degree in Middle Grades Education from <strong>Georgia College</strong>. 
                          my master’s degree from the <strong>University of Missouri</strong> in Learning Technology and 
                          Design.  I am currently working on my educational specialist in the same area.   
                          I taught middle school for 6 years, teaching earth science and life science.  
                          I then took a job teaching high school biology and anatomy.   
                          In 2015, my husband was transferred to Kansas City.  I have taught biology, anatomy, 
                          forensics, and college preparatory at the same high school since. 
                         <br/>  You can often find me at a sports complex or dance studio with my daughters.
                          My hobbies include spending time with family and friends, traveling, reading, and going to concerts. Traveling to all 50 states is on my bucket list.  I have made it to 29 of them. </p>
