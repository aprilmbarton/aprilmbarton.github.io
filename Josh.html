Hello, my name is Josh Dorr.  I teach Social Studies at Park Hill South High School in Kansas City, MO.  I am the Head Girls Basketball Coach.  I have been teaching and coaching for 20 years with my last 5 years at Park Hill South.  I did have some very basic training in HTML in high school and college but that was over 20 years ago. Unfortunately, I have forgotten most of it.  One of the courses I teach is Virtual Government.  I have helped create the class using our Learning Management System over the past 3 years.  I am looking forward to gaining more experience with coding and creating web materials.  With this course I am hoping to extend my expertise in Web Development so that I can use it to help make new items for the virtual course I teach.  I usually spend my free time with my wife Brooke, and our 2 children, Lincoln (age 10) and Charlotte (age 7).  I love to travel and this summer I get to go on vacation to Hawaii.  I am looking forward to going to the Pearl Harbor Museum and seeing the USS Arizona Memorial.
